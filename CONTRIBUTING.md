Contributing ðŸš€
===============

For fixes, improvements or ideas, fork the repository and issue a pull request.

To get a pull request accepted, please adhere to these rules:
- Work from the latest `develop` branch, unless it's a very small fix
- Respect current code style and respect the SwiftLint rules (see swiftlint's file)

Ideally, only work on one feature at a time.
If you've done work on the code (i.e. not just fixes to the README), add yourself to the top of [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Thank you, and happy coding ! ðŸ˜˜
